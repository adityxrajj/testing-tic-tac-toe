# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid, with the option to restart the game at any time.

## Features

- **Player vs Player**: Two players can take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the board.

- **Game Reset**: Restart the game anytime with a reset button.

- **Simple and responsive design**: Play the game in any modern browser.

## How to Play

1. The game board is a 3x3 grid.

2. Players take turns clicking on a square to place their mark (X or O).

3. The first player to align three of their marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.

4. If all squares are filled and no one wins, the game ends in a draw.

5. Use the "Restart" button to reset the game.
